# S3 Class Transmission Strategy for UDKMS Clients

## üìÅ 1. Understand Your Document Access Patterns
Begin by analyzing how frequently different types of documents are accessed. For instance:

- **KYC Documents:** Typically accessed during onboarding and occasionally thereafter.
- **Archived Reports:** Rarely accessed after a certain period.
- **Compliance Documents:** May need to be retained for extended periods but are infrequently accessed.

Understanding these patterns will help in defining appropriate lifecycle rules.

## üß∞ 2. Utilize S3 Lifecycle Policies
S3 Lifecycle policies allow you to automate the transition of objects between storage classes based on defined rules. Here's how you can set them up:

### a. Transition to S3 Standard-IA
For documents that are infrequently accessed but need to be retrieved immediately when required:

- **Rule:** Transition objects to S3 Standard-Infrequent Access (Standard-IA) after 30 days.

### b. Transition to S3 Glacier
For documents that are rarely accessed and can tolerate retrieval times of minutes to hours:

- **Rule:** Transition objects to S3 Glacier after 90 days.

### c. Transition to S3 Glacier Deep Archive
For documents that are almost never accessed but need to be retained for compliance:

- **Rule:** Transition objects to S3 Glacier Deep Archive after 180 days.

### d. Expiration
For documents that no longer need to be retained:

- **Rule:** Delete objects after 365 days.

## üè∑Ô∏è 3. Implement Object Tagging for Granular Control
Since S3 Lifecycle rules don't natively filter by file extension, you can use object tagging to manage PDFs specifically:

- **Tagging Objects:** Use S3 Batch Operations to tag all PDF documents with a key-value pair, e.g., `{"FileType": "PDF"}`.
- **Lifecycle Rules Based on Tags:** Create lifecycle rules that apply only to objects with the `FileType=PDF` tag.

This approach allows for precise control over which documents the lifecycle rules apply to.

---

## üìè 4. Apply Object Size Filters
To ensure cost-effectiveness, apply size filters in your lifecycle rules:

- **Minimum Object Size:** Set a minimum size of 128 KB to avoid transitioning small objects where the cost savings may not justify the transition fees.

---

## üß† 5. Consider S3 Intelligent-Tiering for Unpredictable Access Patterns
If access patterns are unpredictable, S3 Intelligent-Tiering can automatically move objects between access tiers based on usage:

- **Frequent Access Tier:** Default for newly uploaded objects.
- **Infrequent Access Tier:** Objects not accessed for 30 consecutive days.
- **Archive Access Tier:** Objects not accessed for 90 consecutive days (optional).
- **Deep Archive Access Tier:** Objects not accessed for 180 consecutive days (optional).

> Note: Objects smaller than 128 KB are always stored in the Frequent Access tier.

---

## üíµ 6. Monitor and Analyze with S3 Storage Lens
Use S3 Storage Lens to gain insights into storage usage and activity:

- **Identify:** Buckets or prefixes with high storage costs.
- **Analyze:** Access patterns to refine lifecycle policies.
- **Optimize:** Adjust storage classes and lifecycle rules based on data.

This tool helps in making informed decisions to further reduce costs.

## üìù 7. Sample Lifecycle Policy JSON
Here's a sample JSON configuration for a lifecycle policy:

```json
{
  "Rules": [
    {
      "ID": "PDFDocumentLifecycle",
      "Filter": {
        "Tag": {
          "Key": "FileType",
          "Value": "PDF"
        },
        "ObjectSizeGreaterThan": 131072
      },
      "Status": "Enabled",
      "Transitions": [
        {
          "Days": 30,
          "StorageClass": "STANDARD_IA"
        },
        {
          "Days": 90,
          "StorageClass": "GLACIER"
        },
        {
          "Days": 180,
          "StorageClass": "DEEP_ARCHIVE"
        }
      ],
      "Expiration": {
        "Days": 365
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

This policy applies to objects tagged as PDFs and larger than 128 KB, transitioning them through various storage classes and eventually deleting them after a year.
